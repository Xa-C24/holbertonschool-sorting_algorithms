#Introduction
This repository contains implementations of various sorting algorithms in C language, as well as an explanation of Big O notation, used to describe the complexity of algorithms in terms of time and space.

#Sorting Algoritms
 BUBBLE SORT
Bubble Sort is a simple sorting algorithm that compares pairs of adjacent elements and swaps their positions if they are in the wrong order.

 SELECTION SORT
Selection Sort finds the minimum element in a list and swaps it with the first element, then repeats this process for the remaining sub-lists.

 INSERTION SORT
Insert Sort gradually builds a sorted list by inserting one element at a time at the correct position.

 MERGE SORT
 Merge Sort is a sorting algorithm based on the divide-and-conquer technique. It divides the list into smaller sub-lists, sorts them and merges them.

 QUICK SORT
Quick Sort uses a pivot to divide the list into two parts, then recursively sorts the two parts.

 HEAP SORT
Heap Sort builds a heap from the elements in the list, then extracts the elements in order to produce a sorted list.

#Big O Notation
 TIME COMPLEXITY
Time complexity measures the execution time of an algorithm as a function of the size of the input.

 SPACE COMPLEXITY
Spatial complexity measures the amount of additional memory required by an algorithm as a function of the size of the input.

#Usage
To run implementations of the sorting algorithms, clone this repository and compile the corresponding C files. You can modify the input lists in the source files to test the performance of the algorithms with different data.

- git clone https://github.com/Xa-C24/holbertonschool-sorting_algorithms.git

#Conclusion
We hope this repository will help you better understand different sorting algorithms and their complexity in terms of Big O notation. These concepts are fundamental in computer science and software engineering, and a good grasp of these techniques can greatly improve your problem-solving skills. Thank you for your interest
